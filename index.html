    <h1>The Ultimate Dog <br>Blog<br></h1>
    <p>Beauty is a 9yo spayed female that came to me after two different members of her human family passed away. She was very loved and struggled with their loss by going on a hunger strike. Fortunately, she is now doing well and is getting used to life in my care. </p>
    <p>Beauty is a regal mother to some and a grandmother to many, but she is far beyond her days of any doggie shenanigans. Her tolerance for her fellow furry friends has waned recently and she much prefers a quiet solitary life with humankind. At 9 years old, she focuses all her attention on her human social circles, with a preference for a simple life filled with afternoons spent snuggling on the couch and plenty of belly rubs - provided she is your one and only. Silky smooth from years of coiffing, but possibly having had one too many bon bons in her glory days, Beauty is ready to give her whole heart to her next human companion.</p>
